## Documentation
| Software | Description |
|--|--|
| [Atmosphère](https://github.com/Atmosphere-NX/Atmosphere) | Atmosphère is an open-source Nintendo Switch custom firmware (CFW) developed by the Atmosphere team. It allows users to modify and customize their Nintendo Switch consoles, enabling various homebrew applications, custom themes, cheat codes, and other features not available in the official Nintendo software. |
| [Aio Switch Updater](https://github.com/HamletDuFromage/aio-switch-updater) | A Nintendo Switch homebrew app to download and update CFWs, FWs and cheat codes. |
| [Hekate](https://github.com/CTCaer/hekate) | Hekate is a custom bootloader, which allows you do things such as backup and restore your nand, create an emummc etc. While it works hand in hand with Atmosphere, you could say they are two separate things. It has the ability to launch cfw / stock firmware as well as Linux/ Android etc |
